Grocery Tracker Application:
This application was written in C++, and was created in order to assist a company in tracking the number of items sold.
This application uses a switch case statement to choose between menu options which I much prefer to repetitive if statements. 
This code could be enhanced by making the main function much simpler and moving some of the code into classes to clean it up. Functions could then be called rather than doing everything in the main function.
I struggled most to understand and utilize maps, but through many youtube videos and websites such as w3 schools, I was able to understand enough to write functioning code.
Using maps will be an especially helpful skill gained from this project, as they are a great way to store information and very similar to dictionaries in other languages. 
This program was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of many comments throughout and using the switch case statements to organize code and when it is used.
